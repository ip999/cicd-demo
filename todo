fix tests for backend
add frontend (use fresh?)
add ci github actions
check if shiftleft is still a thing?
figure out tags/releases
add cd github actions
add deployment (dockerhub)

argocd plus kustomize

prove it's working...
    in github action add short commitsha into a build arg that is then available as an env var in the container
    in kustomise insert a kubernetes env var 
    in app add version endpoint that outputs build SHA from github and kubernetes
    also display semver?


add terraform

once all is working, protect main branch

if we get all fancy with appsec...
add sql part to app
